## 1. Title of Web Application 

Title: 5 Budak Lapar (Ikram's previous Web Tech Project)

Reason: 
To protect the user data who register in 5 Budak Lapar Web Application

## 2. Introduction
5 Budak Lapar is Web Application that selling fast food while 
pursuing sustainable development goal by allow the user to donate
money that will be used to supply food for needies. The web application
require user to register the account and some of their details will 
be taken and stored into database But the web application itself need 
to be enhance the security to prevent the data from being stolen by the attacker. 
The enhancement that will be impliment are input validation, 
authentication, authorization, XSS & CSRF prevention, database and file Security principles.

## 3. Objective 


## 4. Enhancement

### I. Input Validation 

<H4>Threat: ______ </H4>

<H4>Method Encounter: ______ </H4>

### II. Authentication 

<H4>Threat: ______ </H4>

<H4>Method Encounter: ______ </H4>

### III. Authorization 

<H4>Threat: ______ </H4>

<H4>Method Encounter: ______ </H4>


### IV. XSS and CSRF Prevention 

<H4>Threat: XSS and CSRF</H4>

XSS(Cross-Site Scripting) occurs when a web application allows untrusted user input to be included in its output without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to the execution of these scripts in their browsers. XSS attacks can be classified into three types: stored XSS, reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS. The consequences of XSS attacks can range from stealing sensitive user information, session hijacking, defacement of websites, to even distributing malware. While, CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application on which the victim is authenticated. The attack takes advantage of the trust between the victim's browser and the targeted web application. By crafting a malicious HTML page or URL, the attacker can deceive the victim's browser into sending unauthorized requests to the vulnerable application, leading to actions performed on behalf of the victim without their knowledge or consent. CSRF attacks can perform actions such as changing user settings, making unauthorized purchases, or even manipulating sensitive data.

Both XSS and CSRF are significant threats to web application security, and their impact can be far-reaching. It's crucial for web developers and application owners to understand these vulnerabilities and adopt appropriate security measures to mitigate the risks. This includes input validation, output encoding/sanitization, secure session management, and proper implementation of CSRF protection mechanisms.

<H4>Method Encounter: ______ </H4>

### V. Database Security Principles 

<H4>Threat: SQL Injection</H4>
Code injection technique that attacker use to manipulate data driven web application by inserting malicious SQL statemets into text field to execute the injection. Similar to XSS but more focusing to database server.

<H4>Method Encounter: Prepared Statement</H4>
 

### VI. File Security Principles 

<H4>Threat: _________ </H4>

<H4>Method Encounter: ______ </H4>
